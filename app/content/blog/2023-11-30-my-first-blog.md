# Hello everyone!


Hello! I'm Desirée Jofre, a passionate graphic designer and illustrator based in New York. I specialize in creating unique, aesthetically pleasing designs and illustrations that tell a story.

With a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and over five years of experience in the field, I have developed a deep understanding of design principles and techniques. I am proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, including Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.

My work ranges from brand identity design, print design to digital art. I love experimenting with colors, shapes, and textures to create designs that are not only visually stunning but also meaningful and impactful.

When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring the city's art galleries or sketching at the park. I believe that inspiration can come from anywhere and I strive to incorporate the beauty I see in the world around me into my designs.

Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see some of my work. If you have a project in mind, don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to creating something beautiful together!
